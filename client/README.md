# Zecale client

## Prerequisites

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (at least version `3.7`)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (at least version `19.0.2`)

## Setup

```console
$ cd client
$ python -m venv env
$ . env/bin/activate
$ make setup
```

We assume all further commands described here are executed from within the Python virtualenv. When the virtualenv is active, the prompt will contain `(env)`.  To enter the virtualenv from a new terminal, re-run
```console
$ . env/bin/activate
```
in the client directory (this directory).
